# Youtube Watcher

Some Youtube playlists can cause a trip backwards in time. Great memories rush back. It's a wonderful feeling but 
suddenly the flow is broken when a video that's been removed or changed country viewing permissions causes the player
to get stuck in an infinite loop of trying to load the video.

YoutubeWatcher will keep track of the playlist over time for you, so you can at least find out what the song was supposed
to be.
