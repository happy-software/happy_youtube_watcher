# Happy Youtube Watcher

Happy Youtube Watcher manages tracked Youtube playlists and their histories over time.

# Problem

Rewatching old Youtube playlists can cause a trip backwards in time, great memories rush back.
Over time, videos in our playlists are deleted or become no longer available in our country.
Youtube won't tell you anything about what that video was, only that it's now gone.

The solution? Happy Youtube Watcher.

1. install ruby.

2. install postgresql/setup user account.
